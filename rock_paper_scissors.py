#Question 2
# Write a class called Rock_paper_scissors that implements the logic of
# the game Rock-paper-scissors. For this game the user plays against the computer
# for a certain number of rounds. Your class should have fields for how many rounds
# there will be, the current round number, and the number of wins each player has.
# There should be methods for getting the computerâ€™s choice, finding the winner of a round,
# and checking to see if someone has won the (entire) game. You may want more methods.
